Dear Hiring Manager;

Thank you for taking the time to review my qualifications. If you would prefer a resume to this site, you can find a copy [here](/assets/files/portfolio/Eric-Cloninger-Resume.pdf), while my LinkedIn profile is [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ericcloninger/).

I am interested in a position as a Senior Product Manager, Developer Relations Manager, or other roles requiring a technical background. I have more than 30 years of experience in the software industry and a history of delivering and supporting products in these roles.

For the past 15 years, I&apos;ve been a Senior Product/Project Manager, focused on developer-focused products, developer relations, and mobile devices. During this time, I&apos;ve been heavily involved in the Eclipse and Android open-source communities. I am a skilled communicator, having authored many technical articles and as a frequent presenter at developer conferences. These activities can be seen in the sections below.

Prior to Product Management, I developed software for 18 years. I am experienced at developing desktop and device software with C, C++, and Java. I am experienced in web server management, self-hosted and in the cloud. I&apos;ve contributed to several popular O&apos;Reilly technical books on Palm OS programming and Windows.

In addition to my professional work, I held elected office from 2002-2016 as a member of the local school district Board of Education. I held this post through 3 elections, serving several times as President of the Board. I&apos;ve worked with community leaders on &quot;get out the vote&quot; campaigns to raise funds for three building projects totaling fifteen million dollars.

I live 1 hour from Oklahoma City, where I&apos;ve worked as a remote employee since 2001. I am able to travel for work up to 33% of the time.

Regards

Eric Cloninger

## Open Source

Most of my open source work predates Github, although I will occasionally fork/pull/fix something I find that's broken. My Github profile is [ehcloninger](https://github.com/ehcloninger).

| Project | Role | Details |
| ------- | ---- | ------- |
| Eclipse Andmore | Project Co-lead | Andmore was an Eclipse Foundation project to enable development of Android applications using the Eclipse IDE. This is a fork of the Google ADT plugins, the former MOTODEV plugins, and plugins created by the project members. |
| Eclipse for Mobile Developers | Creator/Maintainer | Eclipse for Mobile Developers was a pre-packaged set of tools for mobile developers. The package was the starting point for Android developers before Google began creating their own full Eclipse distribution. |
| Eclipse Sequoyah | Project Lead | Sequoyah was an Eclipse project to create a platform- and language-neutral set of development tools for mobile devices. Sequoyah pulled in several other projects under one project leadership and release process. Sequoyah had some success with Android development, but little adoption elsewhere. |
| EclipseCon Program Committee | Mobile and Embedded | Served on the Embedded and Mobile Sub-committee in 2010. Chaired the sub-committee in 2012. |
| Eclipse TmL | Project Lead | TmL was an Eclipse project to create a toolset for Mobile Linux. Motorola sponsored the project and appointed me as the project lead. The project was a participant in the first Eclipse Working Group called Pulsar. When Motorola adopted Android as a phone platform, some of the TmL project assets were deprecated. Other assets were moved into a new project named Sequoyah. |
| Android (AOSP) | Contibutor | [I8af2e598](https://android-review.googlesource.com/#/c/41210/) - Initial contribution of Motorola MOTODEV tools code. |
| Android (AOSP) | Contributor | [I5e85c027](https://android-review.googlesource.com/#/c/41980/) - Scripted build files for MOTODEV tools. |
