Dear Hiring Manager;

Thank you for taking the time to review my qualifications. If you would prefer a resume to this site, you can find a copy [here](/assets/files/portfolio/Eric-Cloninger-Resume.pdf), while my LinkedIn profile is [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ericcloninger/).

I am interested in a position as a Senior Product Manager, Developer Relations Manager, or other roles requiring a technical background. I have more than 30 years of experience in the software industry and a history of delivering and supporting products in these roles.

For the past 15 years, I&apos;ve been a Senior Product/Project Manager, focused on developer-focused products, developer relations, and mobile devices. During this time, I&apos;ve been heavily involved in the Eclipse and Android open-source communities. I am a skilled communicator, having authored many technical articles and as a frequent presenter at developer conferences. These activities can be seen in the sections below.

Prior to Product Management, I developed software for 18 years. I am experienced at developing desktop and device software with C, C++, and Java. I am experienced in web server management, self-hosted and in the cloud as well as a solid understanding of web protocols. I&apos;ve contributed to several popular O&apos;Reilly technical books on Palm OS programming and Windows.

In addition to my professional work, I held elected office from 2002-2016 as a member of the local school district Board of Education. I held this post through 3 elections, serving several times as President of the Board. I&apos;ve worked with community leaders on &quot;get out the vote&quot; campaigns to raise funds for three building projects totaling fifteen million dollars.

I live 1 hour from Oklahoma City, where I&apos;ve worked as a remote employee since 2001. I am able to travel for work up to 33% of the time.

Regards

Eric Cloninger

## Open Source

Most of my open source work predates Github, although I will occasionally fork/pull/fix something I find that's broken. My Github profile is [ehcloninger](https://github.com/ehcloninger).

| Project | Role | Details |
| ------- | ---- | ------- |
| Eclipse Andmore | Project Co-lead | Andmore was an Eclipse Foundation project to enable development of Android applications using the Eclipse IDE. This is a fork of the Google ADT plugins, the former MOTODEV plugins, and plugins created by the project members. |
| Eclipse for Mobile Developers | Creator/Maintainer | Eclipse for Mobile Developers was a pre-packaged set of tools for mobile developers. The package was the starting point for Android developers before Google began creating their own full Eclipse distribution. |
| Eclipse Sequoyah | Project Lead | Sequoyah was an Eclipse project to create a platform- and language-neutral set of development tools for mobile devices. Sequoyah pulled in several other projects under one project leadership and release process. Sequoyah had some success with Android development, but little adoption elsewhere. |
| EclipseCon Program Committee | Mobile and Embedded | Served on the Embedded and Mobile Sub-committee in 2010. Chaired the sub-committee in 2012. |
| Eclipse TmL | Project Lead | TmL was an Eclipse project to create a toolset for Mobile Linux. Motorola sponsored the project and appointed me as the project lead. The project was a participant in the first Eclipse Working Group called Pulsar. When Motorola adopted Android as a phone platform, some of the TmL project assets were deprecated. Other assets were moved into a new project named Sequoyah. |

## Primary Job Duties

### Samsung Electronics
Working remotely, traveling 1 or 2 times per month (prior to COVID).

**Delivering Relevant and Timely Content.** Managing a team of internal
and external content creators and developer advocates in maintaining a
constant pipeline of useful information for subscribers. Utilizing
analytic data to find optimal methods to deliver content, while engaging
with audiences through social media, online events, and in-person events
(prior to 2020).

**Forward Facing.** Led the effort to renovate the aging Samsung
Developers site from one that had poor performance and fragmented
responsibilities to one that utilizes modern development methods and
revision-based content control with clearly defined roles for content
creators. The resulting site was delivered in January 2020 and continues
to improve.

**Technical Program Management.** Delivered a strategic web
infrastructure overhaul on time and on budget. Project involved 5
external vendors and 4 internal teams in 6 time zones across 3
continents. This project required extensive cooperation, as each team
had responsibilities that relied on each other. The timing and order of
deployment occurred in a 6 hour window with coordination from a
conference room in Mountain View, CA. Deployment occurred with minimal
interruption to the user base and no loss of functionality in the
migration.

**Keep the Lights On.** Managing server infrastructure for parts of the
Samsung Developers and Samsung Developer Conference web sites. This
involves tweaking system performance, monitoring system availability,
configuring DNS and web server software, managing security processes,
and other tasks necessary to keep a site with 350,000 monthly active
users operating.

### Self

Worked remotely, traveling to client site during project definition, milestones, and delivery. Customized an Android mobile app for oilfield operations.

### Cigital, Inc.

Worked remotely, traveling as needed to corporate offices and customer
sites.

**Build a New Product Line.** Worked with a team of developers in the
US, UK, and India to create automated mobile security tools for medium
to large enterprise customers. Engagements for mobile security were
doubling every 4 months and Cigital needed automated processes to
replace slow and inefficient manual testing. My role was to help the
mobile technical team define the automation and logging tools that
interacted with the customer portal, by designing the data elements and
APIs needed to handle each test sequence.

### Samsung Telecommunications

Worked remotely, traveled 1 or 2 times per month to corporate offices
and development conferences.

**Technical Product Management.** Drove adoption of the Samsung Gear
line of smartwatches by increasing ecosystem offerings. Recruit and
educate third-party developers on the tools and practices used to create
smartwatch apps. Returning community feedback to internal teams in a
constructive manner in order to provide a better experience for
developers and consumers.

**Ensure Product Quality.** Created Best Practices and release
management requirements for internal teams that create tools and SDKs
for external developers. The purpose was to improve the quality in
releases from teams who might not understand what external developers
require.

**Improve Partner Support.** Developed *emulator-only* Android system
images based on Samsung hardware. These were used to allow internal
teams to support partner developers in regions where local hardware
isn't available.

**Empower Developers to Succeed**. Developed self-help solutions for
third-party developers targeting Samsung Android and Gear mobile
devices. For this project, I evaluated cloud-based learning and support
tools, such as MindTouch and Zendesk to incorporate them into a new
developer portal. Created online content to address the highest priority
issues facing developers in the Samsung developer ecosystem.

### Coverity

Worked remotely as a contractor, traveled as necessary to trade shows and corporate offices in San Francisco, CA.

**Product Marketing.** Writing and updating white papers, competitor profiles, and case studies. Working at trade shows, answering technical questions for field Sales team.

### Klocwork, Inc

Worked remotely, traveling 1 or 2 times per month to the corporate
office in Ottawa and to client sites to support Enterprise Sales team.

**Transitioned Engineering Organization to Agile.** Throughout 2013,
Product Management and the Engineering leaders converted the existing
development processes from waterfall to a Scrum-based process. This
process involved converting the internal bug-tracking process based on
GNATS to use a modern tool. We chose JIRA after evaluating several
alternatives. Then Product Management began the process of migrating 8
years of customer requests into prioritized queues, often relying on a
Kanban wall of sticky notes. During this time, the Engineering teams
were still delivering products on a 1 year schedule, but were using the
Product Management priorities and were delivering internal releases
aligned to 3-week sprints.

**Competitive analysis of commercial and open-source products.** As part
of the ongoing need for information about our competitors, I set up a
competitive analysis lab using VMWare ESX servers with Linux and Windows
virtual machines for installing, testing, and analyzing products in a
consistent manner. Focused on the primary commercial competitors of the
company's two products as well as open-source projects to give Account
Managers information about how to sell when faced with a competitor at
an account. Analyzed public information about competitors and updated
competitive information as part of the product release activities.

**Product Release activities.** Worked on two product releases cycles
for two different products. One was a new product, requiring new
marketing content, sales tools and competitive analysis. The other
release was a major update to Klocworks' primary product--Insight that
required updated marketing collateral and event support (webinars, trade
shows).

**Voice of the customer.** In my role, I cultivated relationships with
many of our customers. Two of these relationships were responsible for
10% of annual revenue, while others were smaller customers who pushed
the boundaries of the products' abilities. I built engineering
requirements that would satisfy the needs of large and small customers,
consistent with the company's product strategy.

### Motorola Mobility

Worked remotely, traveling quarterly to department offices in Sunnyvale,
CA

**Build and grow a product.** I managed the creation, delivery, and
launch activities for Motorola's development tools on Windows, Linux,
and Mac OS X. The primary product was a branded version of the Eclipse
IDE, called MOTODEV Studio, that was focused on Android application
developers. Announced in the Summer of 2009, the user base increased
steadily, ending with over 40,000 unique downloads per month. MOTODEV
Studio drove most of the traffic to the Motorola Developer site from
2010 through Q4 2012.

I worked to develop a profile of our users by reviewing server logs,
Google Analytics, and annual surveys. I expanded the user base of the
product by finding compatible distribution channels, such as the Eclipse
Marketplace. Worked on advertising campaigns at popular developer sites
to reach new audiences.

**Leadership.** Led an off-shore engineering team located primarily in
Brazil with some contributors in China. I acted in the role of the
product owner in an agile process. The development team delivered new
releases every 3 to 4 months, never missing a delivery date.

**Evangelize the product.** I created and delivered 24 presentations on
mobile development at 17 developer events between 2008 and 2012. Some of
the topics were related to Motorola development tools and others related
to the Eclipse Open-source projects that Motorola sponsored. At the
events where Motorola was also an exhibitor or sponsor, I acted as our
representative as well as worked in the booth.

**Open-source leadership.** I led several open source projects at the
Eclipse Foundation that were focused on mobile application development.
Motorola was a member of the Eclipse Pulsar Working Group and I handled
many of the technical duties related to this group. I collaborated with
developers from other companies, including several that were
competitors, toward the goal of having a language- and platform-neutral
toolset for application developers. As a project leader, I reviewed,
organized, and presented talks on developing for mobile devices and
embedded systems with the Eclipse IDE.

**Manage the End-of-Life.** Periodically, we had projects and products
that were no longer relevant. I led end-of-life for several services and
product teams. In some cases, this meant the redeployment or release of
employees and contractors. My final project at Motorola was the shutdown
of the entire Motorola Developer site--transferring IP to appropriate
places, writing statements for partners and third-party developers, and
ensuring that linked content from other sites would not get lost.

### Wind River Systems

Worked remotely, traveling quarterly to company headqarters in Alameda,
CA

**Instrument of Change.** Guided development of Wind River Workbench, a
branded version of the Eclipse IDE, focused on embedded development.
Taking input from customers, internal stakeholders, and open-source
projects, I built requirements and negotiated their inclusion into the
product.

**Growing the Business.** As part of a goal to move Wind River into
strategic accounts with IBM, we entered into the Ready for Rational
program. My part in this was to handle all the technical details of the
certification process. My team and I worked to ensure that our product
met the numerous quality and best practice requirements demanded by the
IBM program. To satisfy the requirements for certification, I had to
create new engineering requirements that were included in the next
mid-year update.

**Lead Cross-Functional Teams.** The Chief Operating Officer was
concerned about the unexpected growth in call-center incidents that
required more qualified Customer Service staff. I was tasked to
understand the nature of these incidents and then create a plan to
address them. I surveyed several years of call center data and
post-support surveys and identified a small number of situations that
accounted for nearly 60% of all incidents. These issues were addressed
in future releases, leading to reduced call volume and overall
improvement in customer satisfaction.

### Advanced Financial Solutions

Worked remotely and onsite, commuting to engineering office in Norman,

**Address Product Defects.** I reported to the CTO, handling improvement
projects to the company's product line--payment processing for banks. I
performed a security audit and uncovered a serious login security flaw
related to how account names and passwords were transmitted and stored.

**Drive Organizational Change.** I identified that many of the problems
with the product had an underlying cause in the way engineering did its
job. Developers would check in code with compiler warnings and without
peer review. I argued that the first change should be to clean up all
code to compile at the *lint - 1* (/W3) and force developers to treat
warnings as errors (/WX). The next step of formal code reviews before
checkin occurred after I left.

### Palm

Worked remotely from Austin, TX, traveling quarterly to company
headquarters in Sunnyvale, CA

**Build a Happy Customer.** I was one of the leads on the Development
Tools team, creating tools for the Palm SDK that were used by thousands
of third-party developers to create their own apps for Palm OS. We
created GUI and automated tools that ran on Windows and MacOS.

**Resolve Internal Tools Needs.** As new features were added to Palm OS,
many needed to be exposed to external developers. Some were GUI widgets
and others were configuration settings. I worked with the internal teams
to adapt our tools for these needs. In one example, I discovered an
inefficiency in the way binary resources were stored in our ROM that
saved over 2K of ROM space. For a device with only 128K of ROM to begin
with, this was a significant find.

**See Beyond the Horizon.** In 2002, we realized that Palm OS developers
needed a better environment than those provided by the many non-standard
IDEs and homegrown tools. We researched and advocated for Palm to become
a member of what was to become the Eclipse Foundation. IBM had recently
spun the Eclipse IDE out of their WebSphere team and Palm was one of the
first mobile/embedded companies to build a new kind of development tool
on the platform. Today, Eclipse is the de-facto standard for Java
development and is widely used by embedded companies to provide a
quality and consistent experience to their internal and third-party
developers.

**Growth and Responsibility.** Palm had no presence in Austin, TX in
1999. I worked with managers at HQ to locate a facility and build it out
for the employees we expected to hire in Austin. When a facility was
located, I was the local manager who handled all the logistics. I also
coordinated much of the hiring of engineering staff until a permanent
local administrative assistant was hired.

### Metrowerks

**Pivot the Company.** I started at Metrowerks as a developer who had
deep technical experience with (classic) Mac development, Windows
development, and the Microsoft Foundation Classes. At the time, the
Metrowerks CodeWarrior tools were praised by Mac developers for helping
them make the transition from the M68K chip to the PowerPC chip.
Metrowerks wanted their products to run on Windows and MacOS at the same
time. As part of a focused team, we built the Windows version of
CodeWarrior that used the same code base as the Mac OS version and by
the time we went to market, it was built with the CodeWarrior compiler
instead of Visual C++. This was the beginning of a new chapter for
Metrowerks in the mid-1990's.

**Build on New Foundations.** Once CodeWarrior was working on Mac OS and
Windows, the Company Leaders looked for opportunities to partner with
semiconductor, operating system, and hardware manufacturers. The
solution was to provide a turn-key solution for their internal and
external developers. Metrowerks would work with the partner to create a
product, which would then be sold for thousands of dollars less than
competing products. I led teams focused on PDAs, which at the time there
were several strong candidates--Palm OS, Windows CE, Psion (Symbian),
and Magic Cap. We worked with partners on all these platforms. The most
successful venture was with Palm Computing and I led this team. For
several years, this product brought in \$2-3 million per year on a
budget of 3 or 4 developers.
