## About Me

While it may seem a bit hypocritical for someone with a website bearing their name, I'm actually quite private. I wasn't always this way, but the way companies collect and combine information has made me more cautious in the way I communicate on the internet. You won't find more than passing mention of my children and spouse on these pages. Most of the content is about my work or hobbies. The content related to restoring my 1972 MGB roadster that used to be on this site is now at [my72MGB.com](https://my72mgb.com).

I'm a software developer and I lead the Developer Relations team at Samsung Electronics. My CV is on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ericcloninger/).

I live in a small town in western Oklahoma and I've worked from home since 2000. Before the COVID pandemic, I frequently traveled as part of my work. As travel restrictions are being lifted, I'm back to traveling, just not 100,000 miles per year.

## About This Site

This site is hosted on [Netlify](/blog/hooray-for-netlify/), which is a free service for casual use. I was using AWS, which cost only a few dollars per month, but I kept running into issues with automatic deployment from Github. Someone suggested looking at Netlify, which turned out to be exactly what I needed for this project. 

In 2020, I switched from using Atom to VS Code and I'm finding myself working more on my projects than spending time to get my environment to do what I need. Since I'm a bit old-school, I tend to work in the Bash shell most of the time, using Ubuntu under the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).
