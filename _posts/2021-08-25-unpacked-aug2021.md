Galaxy Unpacked brought exciting new product announcements for Galaxy Watch4, Galaxy Z Fold3, and Galaxy Z Flip3. In this post, we'll go into more detail on how you can create delightful experiences for these devices in your own apps and watch faces.

## Galaxy Watch4 / One UI Watch

The new Galaxy Watch4 announcement shines the spotlight on the new collaborative wearable platform from Samsung and Google. This change from Tizen to Wear OS opens doors for developers and designers to create exciting new designs.

As with earlier generations of Galaxy Watch models, designers can create beautiful work without coding. For Galaxy Watch4, we've introduced Watch Face Studio. Designers who built for Tizen-based devices using Galaxy Watch Studio will recognize how this new tool works.

For creators with existing designs built with Galaxy Watch Studio, there is also a tool to convert from the Tizen .tpk format to the Wear OS .aab format. This tool is called Galaxy Watch Studio Converter. As there are differences between Tizen and Wear OS, some functions are not supported in the conversion process.

For support on these tools, please visit the Samsung Developer Forums for Watch Face Studio and Watch Face Studio Converter.

Developers who are interested in creating applications for the new wearable platform can find more information at the Android Developers site.

## Galaxy Z Series

Galaxy Unpacked brought news of two exciting evolutions of Samsung phones with the Galaxy Z Fold3 and the Galaxy Z Flip3. For mobile developers, these devices provide opportunities to bring a first-class experience to users of their apps by utilizing unique features of the Z Series hardware and software.

Possibly the most notable addition to the Galaxy Z Fold3 is the S Pen, which had previously been available to owners of Galaxy Note and Galaxy Tab devices. Developers can integrate the S Pen Remote and Air Actions into their apps. Code Labs with samples are available to get you started.

To check if S Pen is available on a device, this block of code can be used.

    SpenRemote spenRemote = SpenRemote.getInstance();
                    
    if (!spenRemote.isConnected()) {
        spenRemote.connect(getContext(), 
            new SpenRemote.ConnectionResultCallback() {
            @Override
            public void onSuccess(SpenUnitManager manager) {
            }
                    
            @Override
            public void onFailure(int error) {
            }
        });
    }

Another feature of the Galaxy Z Fold3 that developers can access is the inner display, activated when the device is opened. Developers who want to provide a premium experience for these devices should ensure their apps provide continuity across the displays while interrupting their users as little as possible. Samsung provides a Code Lab and sample code to ensure that your apps provide the best experience possible.

The Galaxy Z Fold3 and Galaxy Z Flip3 also provide a unique featured called Flex Mode. Flex Mode is activated when a user opens the Z Fold3 or Z Flip3 screen half-way. In this configuration, apps are notified to alter their appearance to give the best experience. As with other new features, a Code Lab with samples is available on this site.
