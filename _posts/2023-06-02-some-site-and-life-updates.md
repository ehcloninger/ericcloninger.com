It's been a while, so I guess I'll get off my lazy butt and make some updates.

<!--more-->

I wanted to add Google Analytics to this site as an experiment for some work projects. Getting GA4 going and configured where my Jekyll theme generates the correct content is taking a couple hours to get straight. So that's what's driving this update. I'll likely make similar changes to [My72MGB](https://my72mgb.com) as it uses the same [Jekyll template](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) as this site.

I don't post much personal information on here because I value my privacy and the privacy of those around me. The short update is

* Life has had some ups and some downs. Mostly ups, so I don't have a lot to complain about.
* I started a new job--hopefully the last time I say this. 

There you go.
