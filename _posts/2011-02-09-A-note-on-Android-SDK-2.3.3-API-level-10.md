Google released a new version of their SDK today for API level 10,
targeting platform 2.3.3 (Gingerbread). There is a thread covering the
topic at the MOTODEV discussion boards.

Google released a new version of their SDK today for API level 10,
targeting platform 2.3.3 (Gingerbread). You can find it with the Android
SDK and AVD manager tool that ships with the Android SDK. There is not a
corresponding release of the ADT plugins for Eclipse/MOTODEV Studio.

We've done some preliminary tests and we haven't seen any obvious
problems with using the SDK with MOTODEV Studio 2.1. We will do some
more testing over the next few days, but you can probably start using
the 2.3.3 SDK to build and test your apps. If we find problems, I will
post them to this thread.

Thank you for using MOTODEV Studio.
