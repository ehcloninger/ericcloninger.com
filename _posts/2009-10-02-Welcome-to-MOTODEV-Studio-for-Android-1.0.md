Hello Everyone,

If you are reading this message via RSS, it probably means that you've
managed to download and install MOTODEV Studio for Android 1.0.
Congratulations! If you haven't yet downloaded Studio, *you can get it
here* . We're excited to have you as a user and we welcome your ideas
and input.

We plan to use this Blog and RSS feed sparingly. If there is a posting,
you will probably want to pay attention to it. When we have updates to
the tools, we will create new blog posts, which will alert you to their
presence. If errors are found with workarounds, we'll post them here. If
you keep the RSS Reader open in MOTODEV Studio, you will see these posts
as they occur. Or, you can follow this blog in your favorite RSS reader,
such as Google Reader, using
*http://feeds.feedburner.com/motodevstudioblog* as a feed. When
updates are announced, you can use the "Help-&gt;Update Software" menu
item to pull down the updates directly into MOTODEV Studio.

If you happen to be attending the MOTODEV Summit in San Diego, please
stop by our sessions (TU203 and TU205) as well as a "Meet the Experts"
exchange in the Technical Lab from 11:00 AM until 1:00 PM. We'd love to
hear your initial impressions of MOTODEV Studio 1.0. We're also running
a survey in the lab to help us understand how we can incorporate your
needs into future releases.

Please direct any questions, support issues or other comments you might
have at the *MOTODEV Studio discussion boards.* We'll get to your
questions as quickly as we can.

Code on!
