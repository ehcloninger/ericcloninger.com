Hello MOTODEV Studio users,

There's a new discussion boards posting about the recent release of SDK
2.0.1 and ADT 0.9.5.

The short summary:

1.  The update server didn't work correctly for about 10 hours on 4
    December. It is now fixed.
2.  If you don't need the 2.0.1 Platform SDK features, wait a few days
    for the MOTODEV Studio 1.0.3 update and then update the SDK.
3.  If you must use the 2.0.1 SDK, you cannot update ADT yet. But, you
    can ignore the warning message about incompatible versions.

Have a great weekend.

Eric
