title: "Updating Netlify"
---
I received an email this week from Netlify informing me that the version
of Linux being used to host my site was being deprecated and I needed to
choose a newer version. This was a quick fix, but I needed to force the
project to rebuild so that it would use the newer build. I've made the
change on the site I use to [show off my toy car](https://my72mgb.com),
but then I realized that I haven't posted any content here in a while.

It's been a busy year for personal stuff, but not the kinds of things
that one puts on their website. So, suffice it to say, life is going
on and doesn't suck. Hope yours is the same.
