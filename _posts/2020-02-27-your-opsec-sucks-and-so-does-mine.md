title: "Your Op-Sec Sucks (and so does mine)"
---
A couple weeks back, I was on a flight leaving San Jose on a Friday morning.
The flight left before dawn, filled to the brim with business travelers wanting
to escape the Bay Area before a 3-day weekend.

I had my typical seat on an aisle in the second row of economy. My employer
doesn't let lowly managers book business class or first class, so I'm stuck in
the back of the plane with the rest of the rabble. Fortunately, due to flying
100,000 miles per year, I'm in the front of the back. Next to me, in the middle
seat, was a man about my age. He smiled and nodded as I sat down, but otherwise
made no attempt to communicate. At 5:45 AM, this is a blessing.

As we crossed through 10,000 feet, the flight attendants let us know that we
were free to use our computers. My seat-mate promptly pulled out his trusty Dell
17" laptop (with the extra 10-key) and connected to the airplane wi-fi. Pretty
soon, his elbows started poking into my sides as he moved the mouse and typed.
I tried to shift my position, but it did no good. So, I put on my headphones,
pulled my hoodie up, put on my sunglasses, and pretended to sleep.

What I actually did was watch everything he typed. I quickly learned his name
(Roger) and his employer [redacted]. I learned that he was the CMO of a 2,000
person company located in Dallas, with offices in 10 cities worldwide. I watched
as he had a conversation over the LinkedIn chat system with a person they were
planning to offer a director-level position to. I know what they were planning
to pay him ($220,000 plus 25% performance bonus). I know the person currently
holding this position is going to be surprised when they replace him.

Roger was using Outlook (not OWA) on his Dell and was not using a VPN. He pulled
files from their SharePoint and worked on confidential slides for an upcoming
board meeting.

This is not an isolated incident. It happens nearly every time I fly to some
extent or another. I'm not nosy by nature, but when you're stuck in a metal
tube for hours on end, you need some entertainment besides the 3 episodes of
Narcos downloaded on a tablet.

In December, 2018, I had an almost identical experience. Alex was sitting in coach,
which annoyed him to no end. He had a class ring (2005, Texas A&M) and another
from his military service. He was fit, smartly dressed, and used a Macbook Air.
Every time a flight attendant walked past and moved the curtain to first class,
he was visibly annoyed because the curtain touched his shoes. Each time, he
would demonstratively move the curtain off his shoes, rather than moving his
feet. When I put my arm on the armrest, he asked (with all the vitriol you can
imagine) *"Do you mind?"*

Alex is a Regional Sales director for a company in Dallas in the cloud business.
They have a project going with one of the most well-known companies in the world
and the results of this project will have an impact on their revenues. The
roll-out was failing and the big company was about to make a very public
withdrawal. The panic was noticeable as he chatted with his sales reps and the
VP of engineering over Slack. Again, I made note of the names as I pretended to
sleep.

This time, I did not consider telling him of his op-sec failures, because, quite
honestly, I hate to see a prick like that succeed. Sorry (not sorry).

Who's at fault here? These guys are sales/marketing people and not security pros.
However, they were both working for technology companies and we're long past the
point where anyone with a financial interest in a company can play dumb when it
comes to security. The fault, though, lies with the CISO that let them into the
open world without drilling op-sec into their brains.

In a way, I have my own failures, but it's not letting people read over my
shoulder on an airplane. I have a $35 [3M privacy screen](https://www.amazon.com/3M-Protects-confidential-information-PFNAP002/dp/B006OZEIKS) 
on my laptop and it only comes off if I want the person to read over my shoulder.
