Hey Android Fans! We filmed a series of short videos talking about our
upcoming products and events, so this is your chance to see some of the
people behind the scenes at Motorola. I will be speaking at the *MOTODEV
Summit* on October 6 in San Diego, CA, where I will be demonstrating
*MOTODEV Studio for Android* and talking about advanced debugging
techniques. Hope to see you there! Enjoy the video and for a list of
