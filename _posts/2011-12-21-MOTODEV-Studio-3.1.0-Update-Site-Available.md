**NOTE:** This blog post was originally hosted on the **Motorola Developers (MOTODEV)**. site. That site is no longer online. I've made every attempt to preserve the original content with only formatting changes to fit this site.

Happy Solstice everyone (Winter **and** Summer)!

The MOTODEV tools team has a present for all you good Android
developers. Fresh from the oven (or off the barbeque for our
[antipodean](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antipodes) friends) is a fresh
release of MOTODEV Studio.

In this release, we've added *several new items* :

-   Support for the ADT plugins (version 16.0.1) that were released last
    Friday
-   The automatic translation feature now supports the Google Translate
    v2 API
-   Generated database classes now follow the Java naming standards
-   Automatic generation of code that saves and restores the app state
-   New code snippets

We're doing this release today in a restricted manner (as an update
only) because the holidays are upon us. Many of the MOTODEV team members
will be on holiday beginning this Friday and at different times through
the next 12 days. While we will be monitoring the *discussion boards* ,
we won't be back to our full staff level until January 3rd. We're
confident that MOTODEV Studio 3.1 will be fine, but we won't be as quick
to answer questions as we would be at other times of the year.

Most users should continue to use Studio 3.0.x until after the New Year.
Users who want access to the latest plugins, including ADT 16, the way
to access this release is via the MOTODEV menu. Choose ***MOTODEV -&gt;
Update MOTODEV Studio*** as shown below.

We'll have the standalone installers and a plugin archive ready to go
when we return from the break. We also have something new that I think
you'll enjoy.

On behalf of the MOTODEV tools team, I would like to thank you all for
downloading and using MOTODEV Studio this year. We've had a lot of great
feedback from everyone and we've enjoyed working with you.

Best wishes for joyful New Year and a prosperous and happy 2012.

Eric
