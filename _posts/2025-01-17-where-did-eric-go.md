If you were redirected here, here's how to find me.

I completely wiped my Twitter account down to nothing. Sorry about that for folks who actually linked to my account. It's all gone now. Don't blame me--blame the idiot who owns Twitter.

### Where is Eric?

As far as social media is concerned, I guess I'm on Bluesky. I'm [@ericcloninger.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/ericcloninger.bsky.social). I'm also on Mastodon at [https://mastodon.world/@ericc](https://mastodon.world/@ericc) but I'm not really using that account.

Time will tell where I publicly post, if anywhere ever again.

Good luck out there. Peace.
