For several years, the Samsung Developer Program has resided at SamsungDevelopers.com. Last week, we moved to our new home, and will begin working on new features to make developing with Samsung an even more rewarding experience.

One of the primary goals for our site and the Developer Program is to give you easy access to SDKs, technical documentation, and tools. We also want to help you understand the best way to be successful creating and promoting your products and solutions. That’s why we created programs such as the Developer Discount Program, Galaxy Store badge service, and our recently released Cloud Device Farm. All our existing programs are available for you on the new site, available from your Dashboard.

## What you need to know

### Single Account Login

Moving to developer.samsung.com gives us the ability to use the Samsung Account single-sign-on (SSO) platform. With your one account, you can access your Seller Office account, Galaxy Apps account, and now the Samsung Developer Program (SDP).

If you already have a Samsung Account and it uses a different email address from your SDP account, you will be prompted to create a new SDP account. Once you are logged in under this new account, send us a Customer Support ticket (using Zendesk) and we will manually link your accounts. If you are a developer that uses the Galaxy Store badge service, you will receive a separate message with instructions on how to manage your badge account under your new Samsung Account.

If you do not already have a Samsung Account, visit the signup page. We suggest using the same email address for the Samsung Account that you used when signing up for SDP.
